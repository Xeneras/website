	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
Mythical creatures also known as,legendary creature are imaginary and oftensupernatural animal, often a hybrid,sometimes part human, whose existence has not or cannot be proved and that is described in folklore or fiction but also in historical accounts before history became a science. Some of these creatures are praised as a good "thing" while are others are hated due to their cruelty. These creatures have yet to be found, some people report sightings but there is no distinct evidence to prove its existence.

Below are some mythical creatures that I think are pretty awesome. Click on the creature you wish to learn more about:
